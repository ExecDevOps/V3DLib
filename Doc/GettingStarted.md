### Getting started

On recent Raspbian distributions, QPULib should work out-of-the-box.
It's been tested on the `Pi 1 Model B`, the `Pi 2` and the `Pi 3 Model B`.

##### Building and running the GCD example

To build and run the `GCD` example, enter the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/mn416/QPULib
make QPU=1 GCD
sudo obj-qpu/bin/GCD
```

The `QPU=1` flag to `make` indicates that the physical QPUs on the
Raspberry Pi should be used to run QPULib kernels.  Using
`make` without `QPU=1`, or setting `QPU` to any value other than 1,
will lead to **emulation mode** being used.  As the name suggests,
this means that QPU code will be emulated in software.  This is useful
for debugging, and also allows you to run QPULib programs on other platforms
than a Pi.

Running `make all` will build all the examples under `Examples`.  The output directory
depends on the make flags passed.  For example, `make all` will output to directory
`obj`, `make QPU=1 all` will output to directory `obj-qpu`.  Running `make clean` will
clear out all these output directories.

Strictly speaking, any program that works in emulation mode but not on
the Pi's physical QPUs is probably a bug in QPULib and should be
reported, although there may be valid explanations for such
differences.

##### Overview of Examples

To build and run (assuming that the repo is cloned):

```
make QPU=1 <name>
sudo obj-qpu/bin/<name>
```

- **GCD**       - [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm), The GCD's of some random pairs of integers
- **Tri**       - Computes the first 16 [triangular numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number)
- **MultiTri**  - Like **Tri**, but uses 4 QPUs instead of 1, to computertThe first 64 triangular numbers
- **TriFloat**  - Like **Tri**, but casts floats to integers and back for the first 16 triangular numbers
- **OET**       - [Odd-even transposition sorter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd%E2%80%93even_sort) for 32 integers
- **HeatMap**   - Modelling heat flow across a 2D surface; outputs an image in [pgm](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html) format, and notes the time taken
- **Rot3D**     -  3D rotation of a random objecti; outputs the time taken

##### AutoTest: specification-based testing of the compiler

Another program in the `Examples` directory worth mentioning is
`AutoTest`: it generates random QPULib programs, runs them on the both
source language interpreter and the target language emulator, and
checks for equivalance.  Currently, it only works in emulation mode.

##### CPU/GPU memory split

Depending on your plans, it may be useful to ensure that plenty of
memory is available to the GPU.  This can be done by using
`raspi-config`, selecting `Advanced Options` and then `Memory Split`:
(On a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, 32M seems to be the minimum that works
for me.)
